<p>this is very delicious!!
    Our Diavola Pizza is inspired by southern Italy’s love for heat and bold flavor. The name "Diavola," meaning "devil" in Italian, hints at the fiery kick delivered by the spicy salami (salame piccante) that tops this pizza. We pair this with our house-made tomato sauce, prepared from sun-ripened Italian tomatoes, slow-cooked with garlic, olive oil, and a blend of herbs to create a rich and balanced base.

Fresh mozzarella cheese is generously layered on top, melting into a creamy, golden finish that perfectly complements the heat. The crust is hand-stretched and baked in a stone oven to achieve the ideal texture—crispy on the outside, light and airy on the inside.

To elevate the flavor even more, we drizzle a hint of chili oil before serving, adding depth and a lingering spice that builds with each bite. The Diavola Pizza is not only bold but also beautifully balanced—perfect for those who crave a little adventure in their meal.

Best enjoyed with a glass of bold red wine or an ice-cold beer. A must-try for lovers of spicy cuisine.
